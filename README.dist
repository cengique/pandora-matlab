THE PANDORA TOOLBOX
====================

PANDORA is a Matlab Toolbox that: 
- Makes database management accessible from your electrophysiology project; 
- Works offline within Matlab; 
- Requires no external software; 
- Is flexible, can easily tie with existing Matlab scripts; 
- Can query database as in SQL. 

Installation:
--------------------

Use the addpath Matlab command to add the pandora/ subdirectory to the
Matlab search path. For example: 

>> addpath my/download/dir/pandora-x.y.z/pandora

To avoid doing this every time you start Matlab in Windows, use the
'File->Set path' menu option and add the pandora/ directory to the
search path. Or, create a startup.m file in the '$HOME/matlab'
directory in In UNIX/Linux and 'My Documents/MATLAB' directory in
Windows with the above addpath command inside.

Documentation:
--------------------
